Expression maps for the delightful [Orcophony](https://shop.karoryfer.com/products/orcophony) library by Karoryfer Samples. These are all DIRECTION based (as opposed to "attribute" based).

The key-to-articulation mappings within the Orcophony instruments are unchanged, however I have attempted to order the keyswitches within Cubase along the following principals:

* Map ALL instruments to the same exact keyboard range, in this case the range starting at C-2
* The first (default) articulation is always the most basic "Long" articulation, if applicable
* The second articulation is almost always the most basic "Short" articulation
