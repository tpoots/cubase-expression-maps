# cubase-expression-maps

A small repository of Cubase expression maps I have made. These are all free to use. The set of maps here will be very limited, as I have the [Art Conductor](https://www.babylonwaves.com/) set which covers most libraries. If you are looking for something very comprehensive, that is a good place to look. Anything I provide here will probably be for less common stuff that I happen to own, but isn't already provided by the Art Conductor set.

These are all made with Cubase Pro 11 and I cannot guarantee they will work with previous versions of Cubase.

If you encounter any problems please raise an Issue and include as much detail as possible so I can attempt a fix.
